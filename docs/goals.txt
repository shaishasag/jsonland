json parser/builder

- parsing should be fast with minimal allocation and copying
- API to access parsed json should be clear and easy to work with
- creating json from code should be easy with minimal allocation and copying
- view of json objects in debugger should be easily to understood
- small code footprint
- efficiency for parsing small (up to 1k) jsons
- simple and clear C++ code
- stable order: iteration on object should return element in the same order they were inserted
- convert numbers to string and string to numbers only when needed (JIT)
